YAML-RPC README
===============
Ilya V. Portnov <portnov84@rambler.ru>

The yaml-rpc package contains a small library to organize remote procedure call
(RPC) over TCP/IP network, using YAML as data serialization format.

RPC server should supply a set of "RPC methods", which are simply functions ::
a -> IO b, `a' and 'b' should be of class IsYamlObject. This class guarantees
that values of given type can be serialized to YAML and de-serialized.
Network.YAML.Instances module provides some instances declaration for this
typeclass. Moreover, Network.YAML.Derive module contains (TemplateHaskell)
function deriveIsYamlObject, which will help you to declare `instance
IsYamlObject ...' for almost any ADT.

You can see examples of usage in files Test.hs and TestCall.hs. Haddock
documentation is here: http://iportnov.ru/files/yaml-rpc/html/index.html.

Depends: ghc >= 6.10, network, data-object, data-object-yaml, yaml,
data-default, convertible-text.
